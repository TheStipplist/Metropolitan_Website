A land where comfort and safety wrapped everyone nice and tight, pulled to far at the seams.</p> <p>An ark of humanity with all the living bizarrely marooned despite on land. Their craft now hoisted high! Above them like lamb on the bob them bobbing atop the ground's puddle. They've climbed!</p> 
						<p> Possibly with the same velocity that first got them there.  Who's gonna get there first? They may have all their glory rusted away, it wasn't the wind or sand.</p>

					<p>I really love Dieselpunk, or Decopunk as some call it. It's a big part of why I write and draw these stories. If you look at these subjects, despite the clear flaws and issues of the time. They represent something incredible.</p>
					<p> An Idea of achieving goals and accomplishments that smash the reason of the world circumstances. The same could be said of most great works. Except, there was an imagination with a bright simplicity unseen since early myth.</p> 
					<p>They imagined men and women who flew and had strength unattainable. Those men and women fought creatures much like us but so purely conjectural to common good. At the same time in reality a dark noir all people knew and acted away was everywhere.</p>
